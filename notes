Error  -- is a class

Error
 child classes of Error
TypeError
SyntaxError
ReferenceError

EvalError: Raised when the eval() functions is used in an incorrect manner.

RangeError: Raised when a numeric variable exceeds its allowed range.

ReferenceError: Raised when an invalid reference is used.

SyntaxError: Raised when a syntax error occurs while parsing JavaScript code.

TypeError: Raised when the type of a variable is not as expected.

URIError: Raised when the encodeURI() or decodeURI() functions are used in an
incorrect manner.

stacktrace is the collection of errors in the console????


you can create a new error with 'new Error'

an error will stop the file from running

'throw' is used to tell the JS engine something went wrong
    -is like a return statement. the function stops

the top of the stacktrace is where we produce the error


errors get "thrown" in one place and caught(catch) in another place

//this is a try catch block
try{ /what you want to try an do

}catch(err){

}


we will want to re 'throw'  an error if you are expecting
a certain kind of error but end up getting a different error.
We would check for the one kind but IF we get a diff type,
  throw that error to let someone know that we have a
  diff type of error.

  finally block -- will always execute. good for doing
  cleanup.


err(ors) have messages
err.message
you can just log the err.message and will be converted to a string--
you wont see the stack trace.

err.stack will show the stack trace
error will by default choose the line num and message if none
is provided


DEBUGGING
How can we do this without log messages

SOURCES
-you can set a break point at whatever line you want in the sources tab

you can make changes inside the source tab to test your code

pause on exception - will pause on certain things
